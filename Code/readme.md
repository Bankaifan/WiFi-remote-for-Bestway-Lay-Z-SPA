BWC_v2.0.0 is a LIBRARY. Copy the whole folder "BWC_v2.0.0" to ...arduino/Libraries/
Then open IDE and pick FILE/EXAMPLES/BWC_v2.0.0/...ino
I recommend the Basic_MQTT_with_GPIO version if you have mqtt.

Latest changes
  LSB first to be consistent with datasheet for displaydriver TM1628 (found by @staylo)
  MQTT connection status on main webpage.
  Disable software wdt in bwc loop.
  Display is always max bright (7/7)
