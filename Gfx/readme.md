Jack Smith is contributing with these lovely vector graphics icons. 
I haven't had time to do anything with it so far, but I put it here so other people can use them if they like. 
Jack was kind to let me share the graphics and if you share it elsewhere please remember to give credits to him.

Thank you Jack Smith
